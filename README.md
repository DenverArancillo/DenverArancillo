Hello, I'm Denver B. Arancillo, an Associate Software Engineer at Deltek Systems (Philippines) Ltd., mainly working on automation development and some system development for the team.

My personal project I am currently working on is a [inventory](https://github.com/DenverArancillo/inventory) system, where I try to learn front and back end frameworks.

I would like to try learning other frameworks/libraries that can be intregrated to a front or back end, and other parts of the development cycle like other automation framework and deployment processes.
